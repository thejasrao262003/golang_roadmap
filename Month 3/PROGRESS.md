# ðŸ“Š Progress Tracker â€“ Month 3 (Testing, Web, CLIs & Production Readiness)

This document tracks my **progress for Month 3** of the Go learning roadmap.  
I will update weekly with notes, completed projects, and learnings.

---

## âœ… Overview
Month 3 focuses on **building production-ready applications** in Go.  
By the end of this month, I should be able to design CLIs, REST APIs, write tests & benchmarks, and deploy a polished Go service.
