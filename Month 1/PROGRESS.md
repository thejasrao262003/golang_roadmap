# ðŸ“Š Progress Tracker â€“ Month 1 (Core Foundations)

This document tracks my **progress for Month 1** of the Go learning roadmap.  
I will update weekly with notes, completed projects, and learnings.

---

## âœ… Overview
Month 1 is focused on **building strong Go foundations**.  
By the end of this month, I should be confident writing, running, and testing small Go programs with idiomatic error handling and generics.

## ðŸ“… Weekly Progress

### Week 1 â€“ Setup & Language Basics
**Goals:**
- Install Go and set up toolchain (`go run`, `go build`, `go test`, `go mod`)
- Configure linters and formatters (`gofmt`, `goimports`, `golangci-lint`)
- Practice variables, types, control flow, arrays, slices, maps, and pointers

**Projects:**
- [ ] Hello World
- [ ] CLI parser
- [ ] JSON file reader

**Notes:**
- Key learnings:
- Challenges:

### Week 2 â€“ Structs, Interfaces & Error Handling
**Goals:**
- Learn structs, methods, and interfaces
- Understand Goâ€™s error handling (`error`, wrapping, `panic`/`recover`)

**Projects:**
- [ ] Bank Account struct
- [ ] Shape interface (Rectangle, Circle)
- [ ] Custom error example

**Notes:**
- Key learnings:
- Challenges:

### Week 3 â€“ Advanced Core Concepts
**Goals:**
- Methods (pointer vs value receivers)
- Type assertions and type switches
- Introduction to generics
- Write unit tests and table-driven tests

**Projects:**
- [ ] Methods practice (BankAccount transfer)
- [ ] Generic `Find[T]` function
- [ ] Error handling with panic/recover
- [ ] Testing library with coverage

### Week 4 â€“ Mini Projects & Consolidation
**Goals:**
- Consolidate Month 1 learning through mini-projects
- Apply generics, error handling, and testing in practice

**Projects:**
- [ ] Task Manager CLI
- [ ] Student Grades Processor (CSV + generics)
- [ ] Simple HTTP Server (`net/http`)
- [ ] Utility library with tests
