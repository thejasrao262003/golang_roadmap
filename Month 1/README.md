# 📘 Month 1 – Core Foundations

Month 1 is focused on **building strong Go foundations**.  
By the end of this month, you should be confident writing, running, and testing small Go programs with idiomatic error handling and generics.

---

## 📅 Weekly Breakdown

### Weeks 1–2: Setup & Language Basics
- Setup Go toolchain: `go run`, `go build`, `go test`, `go mod`
- Configure linters & formatter: `gofmt`, `goimports`, `golangci-lint`
- Learn syntax essentials:
  - Variables, constants, types
  - Control flow (`if`, `for`, `switch`)
  - Composite types (arrays, slices, maps)
  - Pointers (`*`, `&`)
- **Projects:**
  - “Hello World”
  - CLI parser (read args & print output)
  - JSON file reader (parse JSON into struct)

### Weeks 3–4: Advanced Core Concepts
- Methods (value vs pointer receivers)
- Interfaces & type assertions
- Error handling (custom errors, wrapping, `panic`/`recover`)
- Introduction to **generics** (functions, types, constraints)
- Writing tests with `testing`:
  - Unit tests
  - Table-driven tests
- **Projects:**
  - Small library with error-wrapped functions
  - Add **unit & table-driven test coverage**

---

## 🎯 Goals for Month 1
- Be fluent with Go syntax & idioms
- Comfortably structure code using modules
- Practice writing clean, testable functions
- Gain early exposure to generics
- Write meaningful unit tests with coverage

---

## 📝 Deliverables
- Week-specific READMEs inside `month-1/week-*`
- Code projects (`week-1`, `week-2`, etc.)
- Notes (`notes/week-*.md`) documenting learnings, challenges, insights
- Progress checklist updated in [root README](../README.md)
